ADCMP573
Needs 5V supply rail to work
Put external barrel on, not a SMA, to KISS

Maybe want to use ADCMP572 (CML output stage) instead?
This would output TMDS, which the FPGA can take... but it needs external 50R pullups to 3V3 on inputs
Zybo doesn't have these...

RSPECL
	Voh = 2.32
	Vol = 1.95V
	50 ohm terminate to VCCO-2

CML is 3.25, 2.85 so 3.05V Vcm, 375 mV Vdiff
Compatible with TMDS_33
